      "Summarly is a great app for my day today studies cuz I spent so many hours by watching educational youtube videos and they were so long.... I got bored during the videos also and I didn't get the keypoints from the video properly... But with summarly that nightmare has ended... Summarly gives me all the keypoints by bulletpoints so it's lot easier for me.. And not only that I can ask questions about the uploaded video as well.. It's really helpful.. So I think this summarly app is very userfriendly and I recommend this app for all the students out there.. Try it out.. It will definitely make your works easier.",
